1. JS is highly abstracted programming language

*** What is High Abstraction?
An abstraction is a way of
--- Hiding the implementation details
--- showing only the functionality to the users

*** Example
User does not know what is happening inside the ATM
     1. Hide details
 
 ะะต is simply getting the by money pushing buttons
    2. Show functionality


*** High Abstraction in JavaScript
1. We don't have to handle resource management and memory allocation
2. We don't have to handle garbage collection
3. Reduces details so that developers can focus on logic better
4. Improves understandability as well as maintainability of the code

JavaScript collects garbage automatically

***Garbage Collection
1. JS automatically collects unused data
2. free the memory with the help of an algorithm called 'Mark-and-sweep'
3. The garbage collector goes through the roots, marking (remembering) them on its way.
4. It then moves on the references and marks them as well
5. The cycle continues until the garbage collector visits all the roots and references.
6. The garbage collects removes all the objects except the marked ones.


JavaScript is a JIT compiled language.
1. Interpreted language
2. Compiled language

***JIT (Just In Time)
1. JS is not a purely Interpreted language.
2. Modern JS is JIT compiled.
3. JIT compiler converts the entire code into machine code and execute them immediately.

JIT- Interpretation
Compiler - Machine Code

In JIT,
JS code is parsed and became AST tree and JIT then compiled the code and execute and optimize

JS is multi-paradigm programming language

***Multi-paradigm
paradigm: code structure that will determine the style or a way of programming.

1. Procedural Programming: 
--- involves writing down instructions
--- tells the computer what it should do step by step

2. OOP:
--- modeling a system as a collection of objects
--- objects contain both functions and data

3. Functional:
--- an approach to software development that uses pure functions
--- to create maintainable software


JS is proto-typed based programming language

1. In Js, everything (functions, arrays, objects) is object except the primtive data
2. a prototypical object is an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object.
3. prototype is a blue print

array ---> methods are in the parent accesssed using .prototype and inherits in the code


JS is dynamically typed

*** Dynamically-typed
1. When you declare a variable, you do not need to specify what type this variable is.
2. JavaScript engine infers what type this variable is based on the value assigned to at run time.
                  let temp = 'name';
                   temp = true;
3. As JavaScript determines the type at runtime we can re-declare the type



JS is
--- Garbage collection
--- JIT Compiled
--- Multi-paradigm
--- prototype based
--- Dynamically typed
--- High abstraction
