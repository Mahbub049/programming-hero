JS internal mechanism
JS Source Code --> Parser (Line by Line read) --> Abstract Syntax Tree (Structure the code as per own requirement) --> 
1. Interpreter Ignition --> ByteCode
2. Interpreter Ignition --> Compiler TurboFan --> Optimized Machine Code ---> ByteCode

JS Source Code --> Parser --> Abstract Syntax Tree --> Generate Byte Code --> Optimize and Compile --> Then send to different processors to execute

V8 mechanism
.js file --> parse --> AST --> Byte Code --> Machine Code --> Execute
