*** Single-threaded
    ---> Single-threaded means only one statement is
   executed at a time.
   ---> JavaScript only has one call stack.
   ---> JavaScript runs code line by line
   ---> Must finish executing a piece of code before
   moving onto the next

*** What do you mean by Synchronous?
    ---> You'll see that until the first image is loaded completely
    --- > the second image doesn't start loading.

*** What do you mean by Asynchronous?
    ---> All the images are loading at their own pace.
    ---> None of them is waiting for any of the others.

*** How asynchronous JavaScript works?
    ---> The (anonymous) function executes the script.
    ---> main() calls first() and first() calls setTimeout().
    ---> setTimeout() pops off the call stack before main() can call second().
